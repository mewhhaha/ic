# Source Examples

Ducklang source examples use the `.duck` extension. The extension is a
repository convention, not a restriction: `Source.load`, `Source.compile_file`,
and `Source.wat_file` continue to accept any exact file path.

Run every example, expected compiler failure, and expected runtime trap with:

```sh
just examples
```

To compile one Core example from TypeScript:

```ts
import { Source } from "../src/frontend.ts";

const wat = Source.wat_file("examples/data/01_struct_fields.duck");
```

Small pure examples marked `IC` use `Source.ic_wat`; structured examples marked
`Core` use `Source.wat_file`. Examples marked `Managed` use
`Source.artifact_file` and receive explicit effect objects through `DuckRunner`.
The executable expectations and deterministic runners live in `manifest.ts`.

| Example                          | Focus                                     | Route | Result |

`effects/01_inferred_io.duck` and `effects/02_annotated_effect_row.duck`
contrast inferred rows with `-> <row>` function types.
`effects/03_cli_stdin_stdout.duck` is a managed-ABI command-line example rather
than a numeric manifest run. Its Deno adapter supplies live `Stdin`/`Stdout`
effects or deterministic mocks when `--dry-run` is present; see
`effects/README.md` for the commands.

## Expected Failures

`failures/compile/` contains 12 programs that demonstrate rejected linear use,
type errors, aggregate errors, ownership violations, frozen mutation, and import
validation. `failures/traps/` contains four valid programs that trap at runtime:
explicit panic, text and struct bounds failures, and a dynamically zero loop
step. These are executable specifications and are checked by `examples.test.ts`.
